# APOD

Improvement Areas:

- Move API Key from Constants.swift to plist, UserDefaults or Keychain as per security concern. 

- Given: The NASA APOD API is up (working) AND the phone is connected to the internet When: The APOD image loads fully on the screen Then: The user should be able to see the complete image without distortion or clipping
